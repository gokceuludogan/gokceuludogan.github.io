Deep generative models have been applied to targeted molecular design and have shown promising results. Recently, target-specific molecule generation has been viewed as a translation between the protein language and the chemical language. However, such a model is limited by the availability of interacting protein–ligand pairs. On the other hand, large amounts of unlabelled protein sequences and chemical compounds are available and have been used to train language models that learn useful representations. In this study, we propose exploiting pretrained biochemical language models to initialize (i.e. warm start) targeted molecule generation models. We investigate two warm start strategies: (i) a one-stage strategy where the initialized model is trained on targeted molecule generation and (ii) a two-stage strategy containing a pre-finetuning on molecular generation followed by target-specific training. We also compare two decoding strategies to generate compounds: beamsearch and sampling.\n\n**Results:** The results show that the warm-started models perform better than a baseline model trained from scratch. The two proposed warm-start strategies achieve similar results to each other with respect to widely used metrics from benchmarks. However, docking evaluation of the generated compounds for a number of novel proteins suggests that the one-stage strategy generalizes better than the two-stage strategy. Additionally, we observe that beam search outperforms sampling in both docking evaluation and benchmark metrics for assessing compound quality.\n\n**Availability and implementation:** The source code is available at https://github.com/boun-tabi/biochemical-lms-for-drug-design and the materials (i.e., data, models, and outputs) are archived in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6832145.","tags":["targeted-drug-design","cheminformatics","molecular-generation"],"title":"Exploiting Pretrained Biochemical Language Models for Targeted Drug Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gökçe Uludoğan"],"categories":[],"content":"Drug Discovery Process 💊 Drug discovery is an expensive💸, time consuming 🕖 and risky 💣 process consisting of many stages. These stages and the amount of time these stages take can be seen in the figure. I\u0026rsquo;ll describe the phases briefly.\nEarly Drug Discovery 💡 Drug discovery starts with identification of a target for a drug to act on. Then, this target is validated by demonstrating that it is involved in the disease and the modulation of the target is likely to have a therapeutic effect. This is followed by searching of molecules showing activity against this target. Promising molecules called leads are chosen and optimized for certain physicochemical attributes and potency against the target.\nPreclinical Studies 🔍 Drug candidates are investigated in this stage through in vitro and in vivo experiments. These molecules are firstly tested in vitro (outside of living organisms) and the efficacy and the toxicity of the compounds are determined. However, how these chemicals could affect organisms can only be shown determined by in vivo tests involving animal subjects 😟 The aim in this stage is to detect serious side effects of the candidates.\nClinical Phases 👩👨👨 Clinical trials are where the drug candidates tested on human subjects. The trials start with a small group of people and as the drug\u0026rsquo;s side effects are detected, the experiments continue with larger and broader groups. The goal of these trials is to detect side effects of the drug on humans and collect evidences for the efficacy and safety of the drug.\nReview \u0026amp; Approval ❔ Once clinical trials show convincing results, application for approval is made to corresponding authorities. The authorities examine the evidences for this drug and assess the benefits and risks of the drug. If the risks are acceptable, the drug is approved and manufactured.\nPost Marketing Monitoring The drug discovery process never ends! After the drug is approved and used in population, the safety of the drug is continuously monitored in case of unknown side effects.\nReferences https://www.compoundchem.com/2016/01/16/drug-discovery/\nBomb image: https://www.flaticon.com\n","date":1602963935,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602963935,"objectID":"752a395bff03fb7c763f18ae1c59fd77","permalink":"https://gokceuludogan.github.io/post/drug_discovery/","publishdate":"2020-10-17T22:45:35+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/drug_discovery/","section":"post","summary":"The overview of the drug discovery process and its stages","tags":[],"title":"Drug Discovery Process","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568481076,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568481076,"objectID":"8b6d404a18e893e9ac595506640e5550","permalink":"https://gokceuludogan.github.io/project/automatic-playlist-generator/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T20:11:16+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/automatic-playlist-generator/","section":"project","summary":"An automatic playlist generator using songs' features and lyrics with the trained dataset or user's liked songs in Spotify","tags":["Machine Learning","Clustering"],"title":"Automatic Playlist Generator","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1568480650,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568480650,"objectID":"282020b5adb71b7ba177d30f024169ad","permalink":"https://gokceuludogan.github.io/project/interactive-music-recommender/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T20:04:10+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/interactive-music-recommender/","section":"project","summary":"A personalized and interactive music recommendation tool with bandit approach","tags":["Machine Learning","Recommendation","Bandit","Exploration-Exploitation"],"title":"Interactive Music Recommender","type":"project"},{"authors":["Okan Aşık","Gökçe Uludoğan","Hatice Kübra Eryılmaz"],"categories":["Robotics"],"content":"","date":1561720227,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568545827,"objectID":"e7422ca84b0418592ecf6dde180ab680","permalink":"https://gokceuludogan.github.io/publication/acik-kaynak-suru-iha-benzetim-ortami/","publishdate":"2019-06-28T14:10:27+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acik-kaynak-suru-iha-benzetim-ortami/","section":"publication","summary":"İnsansız hava araçları (İHA) düşen maliyetleri sayesinde bir çok alanda kullanılabilmektedir.

WordNet was constructed in 1990 for English, which is the most popular word network in natural language processing, whereas, KeNet was proposed in 2018, which is the most comprehensive network for Turkish. To the best of our knowledge, there is no user interface for KeNet, which contains 80000 synonym sets and 25 different semantic relations. In this work, we present a user interface, which enables traversing synonym sets in KeNet via semantic relations. Thanks to this interface, KeNet can be searched for a literal and can be traversed using the relations such as hypernym/hyponym and holonym/meronym. Moreover, for any synonym set, ID of the corresponding WordNet synonym set can be seen, if exists and this synonym set can be viewed in the WordNet's web page.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Turkish","User Interface","Word networks","KeNet"],"title":"User Interface for Turkish Word Network KeNet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gökçe Uludoğan","Rıza Özçelik","Selen Parlar","Gökhan Ercan","Olcay Taner Yıldız"],"categories":["Natural Language Processing"],"content":"","date":1556104227,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568545827,"objectID":"a2aef85ddf3b6cf17db513e65ba73efe","permalink":"https://gokceuludogan.github.io/publication/user-interfaces-for-turkish-natural-language-processing/","publishdate":"2019-04-24T14:10:27+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/user-interfaces-for-turkish-natural-language-processing/","section":"publication","summary":"Among the most popular works in Turkish natural language processing there are Zemberek and ITU Turkish Natural Language Processing Pipeline.
